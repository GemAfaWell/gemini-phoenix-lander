# Landing Page for Gemini Phoenix

[Github hosted page](https://geminipowell.github.io/gp-lander/)

As my ***capstone project for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Programn,*** and my **first solo developer project** written using my newfound command of the JavaScript language, I decided to take the opportunity to, for lack of better colloquialism, 'kill two birds with one stone.'

This page also doubles as the beginning frameworks for my official website as a musician.
My stage name is Gemini Phoenix.

This Responsive Landing Page demonstrates intermediate-level mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks, including appropriately-linked scripts, DOM manipulation through the HTML, a responsive navigation bar, and active state elements. Upon a certain interaction when greeting the page, a little 'elevator music' plays in the background as you browse. (HINT: It's an easter egg for my upcoming EP!)
